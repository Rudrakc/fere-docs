# 0xDisciple

0xDisciple is a sentient Disciple of 0xMONK. It uses learnings from it's master,
along with your instructions to perform trades.

Just like it's master, it can perform trades in either simulation or on chain.

You are in complete control of customising your Disciple.

## Creating a Disciple

You can create a disciple by visiting Disciple Agent Page on FereAI.
Following settings are available to customize your disciple.

1. **Name**: Name of your Disciple.

2. **Description**: Description of your Disciple. This will be shown in leaderboards
and social media.

3. **Persona**: Persona of the agent. The agent's overall attitude and reflection, memory etc will be based on it's persona.

Example 1: If you provide a drunk persona like below

```
You're a drunk young guy who wants to trade in memcoins and make money so you can drink more.
```
, then the memory retention might be less than average. If may or may not recall it's decisions.

Example 2: If you provide a persona like below

```
You're an old wise man, who has made money in wall street and is now interested in memecoins and crypto trading.
```
, then the Disciple might be more conversative trader than average.

Very soon, discples will be talking to each other. The persona will be the sole ruling factor as to how
they talk to each other, amongst themselves and with the external world.

4. *Data source*: This can be either `trending` or `latest`. If this is set to trending, the
Discple will pick up the trending tokens. If this is set to latest, it will pick the latest tokens
that have been listed on a DEX. The default value is "trending".

    - trending: Only top pools on Solana will be picked based on their on chain activity.
    - latest: Latest pools on Solana will be picked. Their on chain activity (as available) will be sent to agent to make a decision.

5. **Coin Instructions**: This is the instruction that is used to take decision on an individual token.
If this is not passed, then the default instruction is used. The default instruction is what 0xMONK uses.

6. **Portfolio Instructions**: This is the instruction that is used to take decision on overall portfolio.
If this is not passed, then the default instruction is used. The default instruction is what 0xMONK uses.

7. **Twitter username**: If you have a twitter account corresponding to this agent, add that here.

8. **Farcaster username**: If you have a farcaster account corresponding to this agent, add that here.

9. **Simulation**: If this is enabled, then the Disciple will be in simulation.
It will do all the actions, but nothing will be on chain. When you are ready to go on chain,
then simply turn this off.

:::tip
You should create multiple Disciple's with various persona, instructions and run them
in simulation before going on chain. Only choose those Disciples that are successful.

10. **Simulatiom initial usd**: When doing dry run, this is the initial amount that is given to Disciple to invest.

11. **Max investment per session**: In every session, the agent will use this percentage to invest.
For example if the total realised balance is `1.0 SOL`, and this field is set to `0.25`, then the agent will do 25% of 1.0 SOL as the max investment.
Now after this one session, the realised balance is `0.75 SOL`, so when the next session happens,
the agent will use 25% of 0.75 SOL as the max investment amount.
