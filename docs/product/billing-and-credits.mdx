## Credits

Every interaction with the Pro Agent or Market Pulse Agent requires credits.

| Agent Name         | Credits |
|--------------------|---------|
| Fere Pro           | 15      |
| Market Pulse Agent | 30      |
| Investment Agent   | 0       |

The number of credits used by each agent is displayed in the top right corner of the chat window.

## How can I earn credits for free?

You can earn credits by inviting your friends to join FereAI. You will receive 200 credits for each friend who signs up using your referral code. Your friend will also receive 200 credits as a sign-up bonus, plus an additional 200 credits as a referral bonus. This means your friend will get a total of 400 credits when they sign up using your code.

## Are there any subscription plans?

We have a top up based billing. This ensures that if you run out of credits,
you dont need to wait for the billing cycle to continue using Fere.
As soon as your balance runs low, the auto top up will charge your payment method
to enable adequate credits.
