# üìç Pin a conversation

## Why do I pin a chat?

Crypto investing can feel like a full-time job, requiring daily research and constant market updates. Additionally, there are specific datasets and charts you may need to review regularly.

With Fere AI, you can easily pin your favorite queries and refresh them whenever you need, saving valuable time. This feature allows you to keep your preferred queries at your fingertips and quickly access them whenever you need to research the markets.

Our goal is to save you time and make your crypto journey smoother and more efficient.

## How do I pin a chat?

To pin your favorite chat, simply navigate to the bottom left part of any query response and locate the "pin" feature. By clicking on it, you can add the query to your pinned list, allowing you to access it effortlessly whenever you need, complete with fresh responses.

## How do I unpin a chat?

The process is similar to pinning a chat. If you find that a particular chat is no longer relevant to your research, you can easily navigate to the bottom left part of any query response and locate the "unpin" feature.

This allows you to declutter and maintain only the most relevant chats in your pinned list, creating a more efficient and organized workspace.

## What are public and private pins?

When pinning a chat, you have the option to pin it as either a public or private pin. A public pin is accessible to the entire FereAI userbase, allowing you to contribute to the community with proper credits. The best public pins are often selected by our editorial team and shared as suggestions on the homepage to assist other users.

On the other hand, a private pin is solely accessible to you, designed for your personal research and workflows.

## Where do I see all my pins?

You can easily navigate to the top right panel of your desktop to locate the "pins" section. There, you'll find all your pinned chats, accessible with just a touch of your fingertips.

## How often are pins refreshed?

The pins are designed for your convenience, refreshing every time you choose to use them again. This feature is particularly handy when researching crypto analytics and charts.

## Are pins indexed by search engines (Google, Bing etc)?

Everything within the FereAI ecosystem remains accessible exclusively to our community, ensuring a secure and dedicated environment for all users.
