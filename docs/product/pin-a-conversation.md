## How do I pin a chat?

To pin your favorite chat, simply navigate to the bottom left part of any query response and locate the "pin" feature. By clicking on it, you can add the query to your pinned list, allowing you to access it effortlessly whenever you need, complete with fresh responses.

## How do I unpin a chat?

The process is similar to pinning a chat. If you find that a particular chat is no longer relevant to your research, you can easily navigate to the bottom left part of any query response and locate the "unpin" feature.

This allows you to declutter and maintain only the most relevant chats in your pinned list, creating a more efficient and organized workspace.


## Where do I see all my pins?

You can easily navigate to the top right panel of your desktop to locate the "pins" section. There, you'll find all your pinned chats, accessible with just a touch of your fingertips.
