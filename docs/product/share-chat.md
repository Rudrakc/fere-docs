# ðŸ‘« Share Chat

## Why would I share a chat?

Let's be honest, crypto is more fun with friends, isn't it?ðŸ˜‰


## How do I share a chat?

To share a chat, we've made it simple with our "share" feature located next to the "pin" feature.
You can find it by navigating to the bottom left part of any query response.

Clicking on the share button allows you to create a link to the chat, which you
can then share publicly.
Whether you want to share your favorite chats with your followers on social media
or collaborate with friends on research,
FereAI is here to support you as your trusted crypto companion.
