Market Analyzer is on the pulse of the news and chatter. It can perform tasks like

1. Summarize the chatter from various social networks and news sources like Twitter, Farcaster, News and crucial events.

## Investment Agent

Investment Agent is our most advanced AI Agent that invests your crypto in
liquidity pools. It works 24x7 and automatically collects fees, withdraws and
balances your portfolio.

### How does it work?

1. The agent finds the best Liquidity Pools on Uniswap V3.
2. It puts your money in that pool.
3. When the pool's APY gets to go down or the price of the token starts to go down,
we find the next best Liquidity Pool and put them there.
4. In this process, we keep collecting fee and rewards.

Cryptocurrency investments are subject to high market risks. Past performance is not indicative of future results. The displayed APY is based on current market conditions and may fluctuate. Your capital is at risk, and you may lose some or all of your investment. Our AI-powered system aims to optimize returns but cannot guarantee profits. Please invest responsibly and only risk what you can afford to lose. This is not financial advice; always conduct your own research before investing.
