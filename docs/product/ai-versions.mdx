**Username**

Use @ syntax to search for a username. Example `@dwr.eth` or `@elonmusk`

It will automatically search for user on twitter or farcaster. If you want to
specify a social network, just ask that in your query.

**Farcaster Channel**

Use / syntax to search for casts in a farcaster channel.
