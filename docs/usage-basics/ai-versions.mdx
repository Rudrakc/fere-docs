# ðŸ¤– AI Versions

## How many versions does FereAI has?

Fere AI currently offers two versions, V1 and V2. We believe in accessibility, so V1 is available to everyone, allowing you to interact with individual AI agents for specific tasks.

For power users looking to save time and run complex queries, V2 is the upgraded version. It enables you to interact with all the agents simultaneously, providing a more comprehensive and efficient experience.

## How do I switch from v1 to v2?

To switch between V1 and V2, simply navigate to the top right panel of your desktop screen. There, you will find a dropdown menu that allows you to seamlessly switch from V1 to V2 and vice versa. This feature ensures you can easily access the version that best meets your needs at any time.
