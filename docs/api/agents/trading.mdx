# Trading Agent

## Overview
The Trading API provides endpoints for managing trading agents, monitoring portfolios,
and accessing trading signals.
This documentation covers authentication, endpoints, and
includes examples in Python and Node.js.

## Authentication
All API calls require authentication using an API key. To obtain an API key, visit the [Developer Docs](https://docs.fereai.xyz/docs/api/authentication).

## Base URL
All endpoints are relative to: `https://api.fereai.xyz/ta/`

## Agent Management

### Create Agent
Creates a new trading agent with specified parameters.

**Endpoint:** `PUT /agent/`

#### Request Body Schema
```json
{
    "user_id": "uuid",
    "name": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "persona": "string",
    "decision_prompt_pool": "string | null",
    "decision_prompt_portfolio": "string | null",
    "twitter_username": "string | null",
    "fc_username": "string | null",
    "dry_run": true,
    "dry_run_initial_usd": 1000,
    "max_investment_per_session": 0.1
}
```
**Description**:

1. `user_id`: The UUID corresponding to the user who is creating this agent.
2. `name`: Name of the Agent.
3. `description`: Description of the Agent. This will be shown in leaderboards
and other places.
4. `persona`: Persona of the agent. The agent will think, and respond based on this persona.
5. `data_source`: This can be either "trending" or "latest". If this is set to trending, the
Agent will pick up the trending tokens. If this is set to latest, it will pick the latest tokens
that have been listed on a DEX. The default value is "trending".
5. `decision_prompt_pool`: This is the prompt that is used to take decision on an individual pool. If this is not passed, then the default prompt is used.
6. `decision_prompt_portfolio`: This is the prompt that is used to take decision on overall portfolio. If this is not passed, then the default prompt is used.
7. `twitter_username`: If you have a twitter account corresponding to this agent, add that here.
8. `fc_username`: If you have a farcaster account corresponding to this agent, add that here.
9. `dry_run`: If this is enabled, then the agent will perform _paper trading_. It will do all the actions, but nothing will be on chain.
10. `dry_run_initial_usd`: When doing dry run, this is the initial amount that is given to agent to invest.
111. `max_investment_per_session`: In every session, the agent will use this percentage to invest.
For example if the total realised balance is `1.0 SOL`, and this field is set to `0.25`, then the agent will do 25% of 1.0 SOL as the max investment.
Now after this one session, the realised balance is `0.75 SOL`, so when the next session happens,
the agent will use 25% of 0.75 SOL as the max investment amount.

Prioritize memecoins that show strong early trading interest, as indicated by high **volume in the first 24 hours**.\n\n   - **Check FDV vs. Market Cap Ratio:**\n     - **FDV close to Market Cap:** Indicates potential bullishness with less risk of dilution. This supports entering a longer-term trade.\n     - **FDV significantly higher than Market Cap:** Indicates risk of dilution; proceed cautiously with tighter risk management.\n\n   - **Review Price Change Trends (up to 24hr):**\n     - Enter trades where there is a **consistent upward price change** across intervals (5m, 1hr, 6hr, 24hr), supported by rising volume.\n     - For a **bullish entry**, ensure positive price change across multiple intervals, particularly in 1hr, 6hr, and 24hr.\n\n### 2. **Incorporate Volatility Analysis**\n   - **Use ATR to Define Entry and Exit Ranges:**\n     - Calculate the **Average True Range (ATR)** to set entry and stop-loss levels. Wider ATR suggests higher potential rewards, but also increased risk.\n     - Set initial stop-loss levels at **1.5-2x the ATR** to avoid premature exits due to regular volatility.\n\n   - **Volatility Breakout Entry:**\n     - Enter long positions when the price breaks above recent volatility bands (e.g., Bollinger Bands), accompanied by strong volume over 6hr intervals.\n     - Avoid entering trades during extreme volatility spikes unless there is consistent follow-through in volume and price over longer intervals (6hr or more).\n\n### 3. **Adaptive Position Sizing**\n   - **Start with Smaller Initial Positions:**\n     - Given the high volatility, begin with a smaller position size to minimize risk. As the trend confirms (positive price and volume over 12hr), gradually increase the position size.\n\n   - **Adjust Position Based on Recent Trade Success:**\n     - If recent trades have been profitable, **increase position size by 10-20%** to capitalize on momentum.\n     - If recent trades have had high losses, **reduce position size** and tighten stops to avoid further losses.\n\n### 4. **Feedback Loop with Last Trades**\n   - **Analyze Trade Patterns:**\n     - Review the **last 5 trades** to identify common triggers for success or failure (e.g., rapid volume surges, resistance breakouts, or social media-driven momentum).\n     - If the **last profitable trades** had similar conditions (e.g., positive price change after volume spikes), replicate those entry conditions for prolonged trades.\n\n   - **Use Historical Exit Points for Guidance:**\n     - If past trades reached a **profit target of 10-20%** within 12-24 hours, set similar targets and be ready to adjust based on current momentum.\n     - If the last loss resulted from holding too long despite declining volume, be prepared to exit sooner in similar conditions.\n\n### 5. **Mid-Trade Management for 12-36 Hours**\n   - **Reassess at 12hr and 24hr Intervals:**\n     - Every 12 hours, evaluate whether the momentum is sustained: check volume, price change, and transaction patterns. If the volume remains strong and price trends are positive, maintain the position.\n\n   - **Trailing Stop-Loss:**\n     - Implement a **trailing stop-loss** based on the 6hr ATR to lock in profits as the price moves up. This allows you to capture gains while keeping the potential for further upside.\n     - Adjust the trailing stop if momentum remains strong after 24 hours, allowing for an extended hold.\n\n### 6. **Longer-Term Hold Strategy (Up to 7 Days)**\n   - **Monitor 24hr and 6hr Volume Trends:**\n     - If 24hr volume continues to rise, hold the position for up to 3 days to maximize gains.\n     - For holds longer than 3 days, ensure consistent positive price change in the 24hr interval and sustained volume increases.\n\n   - **Identify Extended Trends or Reversals:**\n     - Use **12hr and 24hr moving averages (MA)** as benchmarks:\n       - If the price consistently stays above the 12hr MA, it indicates sustained bullish momentum—hold longer.\n       - If the price drops below the 12hr MA, consider reducing position size or exiting partially.\n\n### 7. **Exit Criteria for 3-7 Days**\n   - **Profit Targets:**\n     - Set multiple profit targets (e.g., at +10%, +20%, and +30%).\n     - Use the **last 5 successful trades** to determine the most effective profit levels.\n\n   - **Volatility and Volume Drop:**\n     - Exit if there’s a significant **drop in 6hr or 24hr volume**, as it signals a decline in momentum.\n     - Exit earlier if there’s a sudden spike in **sell transactions** over 6hr intervals, indicating a potential trend reversal.\n\n  - **OHLCV Analysis:**\n    - If the **Open-High-Low-Close-Volume (OHLCV)** pattern shows consistent lower highs and lower lows over 24hr intervals, consider exiting to avoid further losses.\n    - If the OHLCV pattern remains bullish with higher highs and higher lows, consider holding the position for an extended period.\n    - You have OHLCV data in durations of 1 minute, 1 hour and 1 day. Access all of them carefully.\n\n### Summary of Strategy Workflow\n1. **Entry:**\n   - Pool age, FDV vs. Market Cap, consistent positive price changes, and volatility breakout.\n\n2. **Position Sizing:**\n   - Start small, scale up as momentum confirms, and adapt based on recent trades.\n\n3. **Mid-Trade Management:**\n   - Reassess every 12hr, use trailing stops, and adjust based on ATR.\n\n4. **Longer Hold:**\n   - Use 24hr volume and MA trends to sustain the trade.\n\n5. **Exit:**\n   - Based on profit targets, volume drops, increased sell transactions, or external events.\n\n'\''",

As the trend confirms (positive price and volume over 12hr), gradually increase the position size.\n\n   - **Adjust Position Based on Recent Trade Success:**\n     - If recent trades have been profitable, **increase position size by 10-20%** to capitalize on momentum.\n     - If recent trades have had high losses, **reduce position size** and tighten stops to avoid further losses.\n\n### 4. **Feedback Loop with Last Trades**\n   - **Analyze Trade Patterns:**\n     - Review the **last 5 trades** to identify common triggers for success or failure (e.g., rapid volume surges, resistance breakouts, or social media-driven momentum).\n     - If the **last profitable trades** had similar conditions (e.g., positive price change after volume spikes), replicate those entry conditions for prolonged trades.\n\n   - **Use Historical Exit Points for Guidance:**\n     - If past trades reached a **profit target of 10-20%** within 12-24 hours, set similar targets and be ready to adjust based on current momentum.\n     - If the last loss resulted from holding too long despite declining volume, be prepared to exit sooner in similar conditions.\n\n### 5. **Mid-Trade Management for 12-36 Hours**\n   - **Reassess at 12hr and 24hr Intervals:**\n     - Every 12 hours, evaluate whether the momentum is sustained: check volume, price change, and transaction patterns. If the volume remains strong and price trends are positive, maintain the position.\n\n   - **Trailing Stop-Loss:**\n     - Implement a **trailing stop-loss** based on the 6hr ATR to lock in profits as the price moves up. This allows you to capture gains while keeping the potential for further upside.\n     - Adjust the trailing stop if momentum remains strong after 24 hours, allowing for an extended hold.\n\n### 6. **Longer-Term Hold Strategy (Up to 7 Days)**\n   - **Monitor 24hr and 6hr Volume Trends:**\n     - If 24hr volume continues to rise, hold the position for up to 3 days to maximize gains.\n     - For holds longer than 3 days, ensure consistent positive price change in the 24hr interval and sustained volume increases.\n\n   - **Identify Extended Trends or Reversals:**\n     - Use **12hr and 24hr moving averages (MA)** as benchmarks:\n       - If the price consistently stays above the 12hr MA, it indicates sustained bullish momentum—hold longer.\n       - If the price drops below the 12hr MA, consider reducing position size or exiting partially.\n\n### 7. **Exit Criteria for 3-7 Days**\n   - **Profit Targets:**\n     - Set multiple profit targets (e.g., at +10%, +20%, and +30%).\n     - Use the **last 5 successful trades** to determine the most effective profit levels.\n\n   - **Volatility and Volume Drop:**\n     - Exit if there’s a significant **drop in 6hr or 24hr volume**, as it signals a decline in momentum.\n     - Exit earlier if there’s a sudden spike in **sell transactions** over 6hr intervals, indicating a potential trend reversal.\n\n  - **OHLCV Analysis:**\n    - If the **Open-High-Low-Close-Volume (OHLCV)** pattern shows consistent lower highs and lower lows over 24hr intervals, consider exiting to avoid further losses.\n    - If the OHLCV pattern remains bullish with higher highs and higher lows, consider holding the position for an extended period.\n    - You have OHLCV data in durations of 1 minute, 1 hour and 1 day. Access all of them carefully.\n\n### Summary of Strategy Workflow\n1. **Entry:**\n   - Pool age, FDV vs. Market Cap, consistent positive price changes, and volatility breakout.\n\n2. **Position Sizing:**\n   - Start small, scale up as momentum confirms, and adapt based on recent trades.\n\n3. **Mid-Trade Management:**\n   - Reassess every 12hr, use trailing stops, and adjust based on ATR.\n\n4. **Longer Hold:**\n   - Use 24hr volume and MA trends to sustain the trade.\n\n5. **Exit:**\n   - Based on profit targets, volume drops, increased sell transactions, or external events.\n\n'",

**Description**:

1. Amongst other details, you will get the private key of Solana and EVM Wallets of the
agent. This is shown only once, and you should store it (or show it to user). This is
in the fields `sol_pvt_key` and `evm_pvt_key`. These private keys can be imported in
any wallet (ex: Metamask or Phantom).
2. The Agent ID in field `id` should be used in subsequent requests.
3. Once the agent is created, and `is_active` is set to `true`, then the agent
will automatically run every few minutes. This duration is currently approx
5 mins.
