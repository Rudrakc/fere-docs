A trading agent is a sentient agent that performs trades autonomously. This
agent is in charge of the decisions it takes.
You can provide prompts and personas which defines its character and trading
decisions.

:::tip
We recommend doing a simulation of your agents (by enabling it in `dry run` mode)
before making it perform on chain trades

The Trading API provides endpoints for managing trading agents, monitoring portfolios,
and accessing trading signals.
This documentation covers authentication, endpoints, and
includes examples in Python and Node.js.
