# Setting up API Key

You can get an API key
by contacting us via [this form](https://forms.gle/RBm6YtBmSgM3WA5T9).

## API Credits

Based on your usage, we will tailor a plan for you. For the plan, your
account will be given a certain number of credits. The credits will be
deducted based on the number of requests you make to our API.

Once your credits are consumed the responses will not happen.
