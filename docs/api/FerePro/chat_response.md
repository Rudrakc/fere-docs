# Interpreting chat response

The response is streamed. There are various components of the response that you should be aware of.

## The internal status

This is the status of what the agents are doing internally. This comes as a single line of string.
You may choose to show this to the end user, or choose to ignore it completely.

Examples of such response:

1. `Boss ðŸ¤– to Team ðŸ‘«ðŸ‘«: (Internal Convo)`
2. `Team ðŸ‘«ðŸ‘« to Boss ðŸ¤–: (Internal Convo)`
3. `Thinking of using social searched to get some data.`
4. `Yes, we're done. Preparing report.`


## Intermediate data

This is the data that the agents are processing internally. You may show this data
to the user to let them know what has been happening behind the scenes.

The intermediate data can be of one of the following python schemas

### SocialPost

```python
class SocialPost:
  type: Annotated[str, "The type of the social post. Ex: tweet, cast"]
  text: Annotated[str, "The text of the post"]
  published: Annotated[str, "The timestamp of the post"]
  interaction_count: Annotated[int, "The reaction count of the post"]
  url: Annotated[str, "The url of the post"]
  author: Annotated[str, "The author of the post"]

class SocialSearchResponse:
  query: Annotated[str, "The query used to search"]
  posts: Annotated[list[SocialPost] | None, "The list of posts returned"]
```

Example:

```json
{
    "query": "BTC",
    "posts": [
        {
            "type": "cast",
            "text": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has returned to the $67,500 price range after a massive fall in the digital currency market and significant withdrawals from exchanges.

  author: Annotated[str | None, "Author of the News"] = None

class NewsResponse:

  news_items: Annotated[list[NewsItem], "List of News Items"]
```

## Streaming response

This is the final streaming response that the agents are sending to you. This
data comes in the format

```json
{"chunk": "a set of strings"}
```

## Final response

This is the final response that the agents are sending to you.
The Python Schema for this is the following


```python
class ChatResponse(BaseModel):
  answer: str # The final answer
  chat_id: UUID # The chat id
  representation: list[dict[str, Any]] | None # The representation of the answer
  agent_api_name: str # The agent API name
  query_summary: str # The query summary
  agent_credits: float # The agent credits used
  credits_available: float # The credits available
```

Here's what these fields mean

1. `answer` - The final answer
2. `chat_id` - The chat id
3. `representation` - The representation of the answer. This contains the sources
that have been used to populate the answer. This is an object and contains
following fields.

    {"type": "symbols", "value": [],
    {"type": "nfts", "value": [],
    {"type": "tweets", "value": [],
    {"type": "casts", "value": []),
    {"type": "news", "value":[],
    {"type": "coins_data", "value": [],
  ]
```

4. `agent_api_name` - The agent API name. This is same as the agent_api_name in request.
5. `query_summary` - The query summary. A 3 -5 word summary of the user's question
6. `agent_credits` - The agent credits used in this call.
7. `credits_available` - The credits available globally.
