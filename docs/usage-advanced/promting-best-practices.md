# üë©‚Äçüíª Prompting Best Practices

## How do I get better responses?

To get better responses from Fere AI, focus on clarity and specificity in your prompts. Here are a few tips:

**- Be Specific:** Clearly state what information you need. Instead of asking, "Tell me about Bitcoin," try, "What are the key factors affecting Bitcoin's price in 2024?"

**- Provide Context:** Give background information to help the AI understand the context. For example, "I'm writing a blog post about the impact of blockchain on supply chain management. Can you provide some recent examples and statistics?"

**- Ask Follow-Up Questions:** If you need more detailed information, break down your questions. Start with a broad question, then follow up with more specific ones based on the response.

**- Use Clear Language:** Avoid jargon or ambiguous terms that might confuse the AI. Simple, direct language leads to better comprehension and more accurate responses.

**- Experiment and Iterate:** Try different phrasings and see which prompts yield the best results. AI learning is a process, and refining your approach can lead to progressively better answers.

By honing your prompt-writing skills, you can unlock more precise and insightful responses, enhancing your marketing efforts and making your AI interactions more productive.

## How do I set the context of previous chats?

To set the context of previous chats when interacting with AI, follow these steps for more cohesive and relevant responses:

**- Reference Key Points:** Summarize important details from your previous conversations. For example, "In our last chat, we discussed Bitcoin's market trends. Now, can we explore Ethereum's latest updates?"

**- Provide Background Information:** Briefly outline the context or background. For instance, "Last week, we talked about blockchain technology for supply chain management. Today, I'd like to focus on its impact on food safety."

**- Maintain Consistency:** Keep your inquiries consistent with previous discussions. Use similar language and terminology to help the AI recognize the ongoing topic.

**- Use Direct References:** Mention specific details or questions from earlier interactions. For example, "You previously mentioned decentralized finance (DeFi). Can you elaborate on its potential risks?"

**- Segment Your Queries:** Break down complex topics into smaller, manageable parts. Refer back to earlier segments to build on the conversation. For instance, "Earlier, we covered the basics of smart contracts. Now, let's delve into their legal implications."

By effectively setting the context of previous chats, you can ensure smoother, more relevant interactions, enhancing the overall experience and getting more accurate and useful responses.

## How do I handle sensitive information?
